Hello Everyone,

I have uploaded this project in August 2024. Over time, it may not work as intended due to updates in Android Studio. You might need to make some changes to ensure compatibility with newer versions of Android Studio.

Thank you!

Note: You need to add your API key from OpenWeatherMap (openweathermap.org) in the file "app/src/main/java/com/example/weatherapp/MainActivity.kt"
